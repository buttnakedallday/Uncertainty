# Uncertainty


This is a package that was created to calculate uncertanty in lab calculations for ME labs. Fell free to use.
Improvements are welcome. 

dependents:
    numpy,
    sympy,
    pandas,
    matplotlib;

Multivariable_Propagation:
Uses the method of multivariable propagetion (seen here) to calculate uncertanty in calculations

Monte_carlo_dist:
Used to create a randomly sampled distribution of numbers based on the uncertanty in the measurment made
and evaluate the equation using element-wise operators. The result is a distribution representing uncertanty
of the calculated value. Method seen in video here (All credit for this video goes to Dr. Robert Fithen of ATU).
